# College
A database application using a typical college schema.

For this database application, consider a UNIVERSITY database that keeps track of students and their majors, transcripts, and registration as well as of the university’s course offerings. The database also keeps track of the sponsored research projects of faculty/graduate students and so on.


Shipped with this database application are these core functionalities:
User-Authentication-System, User-Permissions-Management, 
Activities Logging, 
Internationalisation.
Interface customization.



I seeded this application with 3 users, their username and password is below.
